A Simple Tetris Clone
---------------------

I Have Plans to make this embeddable, I.e you just include the div in your page and you can play tetris.

But it is still buggy

Things that need attention:

1) sometimes dropping piece into a gap will bug out and delete pieces around it.
2) while dropping down beside an ajacent piece and trying to slide a piece underneath
can sometimes result in deleting the piece adjacent
3) although Im happy with the rotation, it tends to move to an unnatural position
